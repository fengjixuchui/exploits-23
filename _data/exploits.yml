    1.0.1n, 1.0.1o, 1.0.2b, and 1.0.2c does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints
    cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows
    remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended
    certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate.

- description: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g
    do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers
    to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger
    a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c
